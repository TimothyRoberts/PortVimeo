## Vimeo to React Portfolio

This project was created to make a portfolio website for a Vimeo user. Vimeo is a website where users can upload and share high quality videos to their profile. This application pulls the user information and videos from a Vimeo profile using the Vimeo API. That information is then loaded into a react portfolio page.
